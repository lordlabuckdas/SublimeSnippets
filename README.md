# Sublime Snippets

a compilation of sublime snippets that i use for competitive programming

i have also included 2 **build systems** - [cpp](./CPP.sublime-build) and [py](Pyy.sublime-build)

there is also an [autocompletions file](./basic.sublime-completions)

some of the triggers might conflict with the existing ones
