# Sublime Snippets

a compilation of sublime snippets that i use for competitive programming

i have also included 2 **build systems** - [cpp](./CPP.sublime-build) and [py](Pyy.sublime-build)

there is also an [autocompletions file](./basic.sublime-completions)

some of the triggers might conflict with the existing ones, so i suggest:

* download Package Resource Viewer using Package Control
* extract C++
* go to Packages/C++/Snippets
* delete the contents of the conflicting snippets but not the file (we need the 0KB file) because this local folder overwrites the standard one
* delete the unaltered snippets and files, so that they receive updates
